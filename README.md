# cargo-template

## Totally a work-in-progress

`cargo new` already gives you the basic `Cargo.toml`, but that's not enough to get going.
You probably want more metadata (Repository, Documentation, License), maybe some default dependencies (e.g. [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy)) and definitely a CI ([travis-cargo](https://github.com/huonw/travis-cargo/) does the complicated stuff for you).

Most of the information is there already, so let's use that.
